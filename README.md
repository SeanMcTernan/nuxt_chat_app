# Nuxt + Netlify AI Starter

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/d5efd8aa-ae58-4fae-8633-c8c35c46bf3e/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/nuxt-ai-chat/deploys)

This is a [Nuxt.js](https://nuxt.com/) v3 project bootstrapped with [`create nuxt`](https://github.com/nuxt/cli) and set up to be instantly deployed to [Netlify](https://url.netlify.com/SyTBPVamO)! You can take a look at the live version of the site [here](https://nuxt-ai-chat.netlify.app).

This project is a simple chat app that gives you the option to deploy either [Anthropics Claude Sonnet](https://www.anthropic.com/claude) or [OpenAI's GPT-4o Mini](https://openai.com/index/gpt-4o-mini-advancing-cost-efficient-intelligence/). It is a very minimal site that includes 2 server functions that call the models depending on what environment variable you set. 

With Netlify, you'll have access to features like [Branch Deploys](https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/overview/#branches-and-deploys) and [Deploy Previews](https://docs.netlify.com/deploy-preview/), so we encourage you to deploy this, modify it, learn and have fun!

(If you click this button, it will create a new repo for you that looks exactly like this one, and sets that repo up immediately for deployment on Netlify)

⚠️ **Warning** ⚠️

This project will deploy a live site available all over the web. If you do not want your Model being hit directly from the public internet, we recommend locking your site on Netlify using [Site Protection](https://docs.netlify.com/security/secure-access-to-sites/site-protection/#basic-password-protection-versus-team-login-protection)
